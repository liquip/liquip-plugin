# liquip
Liquip is a paper-only plugin. It adds additional gameplay-features to Minecraft like the ability to add "custom" items.
The items are not really new materials but rather already existing items that have uniquie features and may be retextured.

## Current state of the project
Currently a lot of features are missing. If you got any suggestions you can share them on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/WfzeWjBpeY).
